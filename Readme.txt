These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly avaiable, in addition to restricting access to the network.
The jumpbox will provide us a single, secure location to ssh and manage VM's, containers and applications without the need of configuring 
security groups for each.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the configuration and system logs.
What does Filebeat watch for?_Filebeat helps generate and organize log files to send to Logstash and Elasticsearch. 
Specifically, it logs information about the file system, including which files have changed and when. Filebeat is often used to 
collect log files from very specific files, such as those generated by Apache, Microsoft Azure tools, the Nginx web server, and 
MySQL databases.
What does Metricbeat record?  Metricbeat collects machine metrics, such as uptime.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| DVWA-VM1 |  VM      | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| DVWA-VM2 |  VM      | 10.0.0.7   | Linux            |


### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jumpbox machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
Add whitelisted IP addresses:  40.117.133.20

Machines within the network can only be accessed by ssh via the jumpbox
Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address:  The jumpbox 10.0.0.4 

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     		| Publicly Accessible 	| Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------		|---------------------	|----------------------|
| Jump Box 		|   Yes	        	|  63.231.153.35     |
| Elk      		|   Yes               	|  63.231.153.35       |
| Readteam to Jump          Yes                 |  40.117.133.20                    |
  Elk ports		    No			   10.0.0.5, 10.0.0.7
  
### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_ Ensures that scripts run identically everywhere.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
1.  Download Elk
2.  Install Docker
3.  Write Playbook
4.  Edit configuration file
5.  Run Playbook.


The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_10.0.0.5, 10.0.0.7

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
Specify which Beats you successfully installed_10.0.0.5, 10.0.0.7

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._
Beats are open source data shippers that you install as agents on your servers to send operational data to elasticsearch.  There are several
different kinds of beats that collect different types of information such as; Auditbeat, Filebeat, Heartbeat, etc. Auditbeat collects the
same type of information from linux as auditd which allows you to carefully watch lists of directories on Linux, macOS and Windows.  For example, if there are file changes, logs are sent in real 
time to Elasticseach in regards to the audit chance.
 
### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the yml file to /etc/ansible.
- Update the config file to include the internal IP addresses and the remote user name.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to curl localhost/setup.php to check that the installation worked as expected.

Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? yml.Where do you copy it? /etc/ansible
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? Configuration file.  How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? In the host file.
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? Public IP address of the VM with :5601 as the port number.

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
